A project to fine-tune a small, cost-effective Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically correct common markdown and capitalization errors in Romanian text.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a specialized, fine-tuned LLM that acts as a "post-processor" for text generated by other LLMs. It is designed to fix specific, recurring stylistic issues in Romanian language markdown to improve its quality and readability.

## The Problem
Many general-purpose LLMs, while proficient in generating Romanian text, often introduce stylistic artifacts that are incorrect or non-standard for the language. This project targets two common and frustrating types of problems:

1. **Wasteful Markdown:** Titles and headers are often generated with redundant formatting, such as using both a hash (#) and bold markdown (\*\*...\*\*) for the same title (e.g., `# **Titlul Meu**`).
2. **Incorrect Capitalization:** The models frequently apply English-style "Title Case" to Romanian headers, which is grammatically incorrect. Romanian titles should use "Sentence case."

* **Incorrect:** `# **Un Exemplu De Titlu În Stil Englezesc Cu Markdown Inutil**`
* **Correct:** `# Un exemplu de titlu în stil românesc cu markdown corect`

## The Solution
This project solves the problem by fine-tuning a small, efficient LLM on a curated dataset of "before-and-after" examples. This process teaches the model to recognize and correct these specific formatting errors.

The model chosen for this task is **OpenAI's gpt-4.1-nano**. This decision was based on a detailed analysis of performance and cost-effectiveness:

* **Cost:** It offers the lowest price for both training and inference on the OpenAI platform.
* **Pricing Model:** It uses a serverless, pay-as-you-go model with no fixed monthly hosting fees, making it ideal for personal projects and intermittent use.
* **Capability:** While small, the model is more than capable of learning the specific stylistic rules required for this narrow task.
